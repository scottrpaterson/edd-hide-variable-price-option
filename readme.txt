In EDD if you sell software licenses with variable pricing, and you want to change your site license count per price option, EDD will not grandfather existing licenses.

Example: You sell a 2 site license on your site. If someone purchases this, then you decide to change that to a 1 site license, the customer that purchased will be downgraded to a 1 site license. This is really annoying.

This plugin fixes this problem. In the download post type, a new metabox is created, which allows you to seperate with a comma, the price variations to hide on the sales page.

You will make a new variation for each new site license option you want. By doing this, your existing customers will get to keep their site license count, but you can sell new customers a different license count.
